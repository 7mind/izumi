# Motivation

There's much written on the benefit of Dependency Injection.

Motivation for Dependency Injection frameworks in OOP:

- [Zenject: is this overkill?](https://github.com/svermeulen/Zenject#theory)

- [IoC in 2003](https://paulhammant.com/files/JDJ_2003_12_IoC_Rocks.pdf) - 
  nowadays what the article calls. `distage`
  
- Example: Code sharing

 To extend the example, If your code spans over multiple repositories – for example, your company has `sdk` + 3 dependent apps, and the constructor has been changed in sdk, you will now have to update 4 repositories.
This is clearly _very_ unmodular – 4 applications were broken by an irrelevant implementation detail!
\item IMHO using DI as a concept – accepting modules as arguments, instead of using global objects – implicits included – is a #1 prerequisite for modularity,
while wiring implicitly is a #2 prerequisite – without those you simply can't share modules!

DI solves the problem of modularity in large systems. Not having problems solvable by DI is great. But when systems grow
to encompass several repos it becomes more important. For example, let's assume you have 4 separate repos - 3 apps, 1 shared sdk.
If in these 3 apps you instantiate an sdk class explicitly, and that class e.g. added a new argument, now you have to update
instantiations in all 3 apps. If we think of classes as first-class modules, this is clearly unmodular

Motivation for Dependency Injection frameworks in functional programming:

- [Haskell registry: modules as records of functions](https://github.com/etorreborre/registry/blob/master/doc/motivation.md)
- [Wire Once, Rewire Twice - Dependency Injection in Haskell by etorreborre](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/12299-wire-once-rewire-twice)
- [Dependency Injection and FP in Scala](https://blog.softwaremill.com/what-is-dependency-injection-8c9e7805502f)

Note: despite being a Haskell library, the `registry` DI framework above is *less* principled than `distage` due to not offering
a first-class representation for its operations. That is, registry's flow is `registry(moduleDef) -> program`, same as in Guice's `bindings -> program`,
whereas distage has an additional interpretation stage: `moduleDef -> plan (operations) -> program`.
The sequence of operations in a `plan` fully specifies Injector's behavior ahead of time - it has no branches of its own.
This makes `distage` easily extensible by just rewriting plans before execution, see `distage-config` for an example.
On the contrary, that while `registry` can _trace_ its execution to print an operations sequence post-factum, you can't use the resulting operations as an
input to registry itself. Registry Ops do not define the steps the algorithm will take, only trace, thus failing to achieve
extensibility in that direction.

// Haskell-land is a nightmare for anyone concerned with modularity. importing B into A should ALWAYS succeed, A should not be impacted by internal implementation of B, even if B imports A – this can, and SHOULD always be resolved.
// Similarly, modules should not be dependent on application data flow, if a module changes signature as to require a new collaborator, it's users SHOULD not be affected by this change – they should NEVER be impacted by changes in a module's implementation

di as a pattern:

- define programs as collections of components
- trust types
- program orthogonally

- di in .Net image
- softwaremill

what does di framework buy you on top:

- wire implicitly across repository boundaries
- debug easily with plain data plans vs. opaque implicit resolution
- override specific modules in tests or in runtime depending on configuration
- deal with global resources

  = trade offs
  - another set of rules on top of scala
  - although any large program will grow its own organizational structure and 
    distage strives to nullify code changes outside of modules
  // - distage also dumps equivalent scala code

distage improves on others:

- guaranteed termination (no laziness)
- singleton-only semantics (non-singletons are bogus)
- reified plan, the DI program is a transparent, debuggable set of instructions
- compile-time guarantees, if it compiles it will start
- compile-time guarantees that do not lose runtime flexibility
- polymorphic modules (i.e. change your DI program from cats IO to monix or ZIO with one line change – or at runtime)
- natural driver for tagless final and mtl-style classes
  - easily create algebras that depend on resources
  - explicitly specify the implicit domain of your program, shady local imports can't ruin your program anymore
- resource management

the big innovations are:

1. refiied plan
2. strict execution
3. singleton only semantic
4. gc
