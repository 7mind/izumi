DiStage Dependency Injection Framework
============

DiStage is a modern dependency injection framework for modern Scala, like Scala itself, DiStage seeks to combine the best practices of FP with the best practices of OOP, to form its own, unique paradigm of development.

Taking pervasive type safety, composition and separation of declaration and execution from FP, and modularity, scalability and late binding from OOP,
DiStage brings together a fusion that retains safety and clarity of pure FP without sacrificing full runtime flexibility and configurability of traditional 
runtime dependency injection frameworks such as Guice.
