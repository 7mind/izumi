  *
  *                 Garbage collector will remove all bindings that aren't direct or indirect dependencies
  *                 of the chosen root DIKeys from the plan - they will never be instantiated.
  *
  *                 Effectively, garbage collector selects and creates a *sub-graph* of the largest possible object graph
  *                 that can be described by `bindings`, the sub-graph that can includes components designated as `roots`
  *                 and their required dependencies.
  *
  *                 On [[GCMode.NoGC]] garbage collection will not be performed â€“ that would be equivalent to
  *                 designating _all_ DIKeys as roots. _Everything_ described in `bindings` will be instantiated eagerly.
