/**
  * Input for [[Planner]]
  *
  * @param bindings Bindings. Can be created using [[izumi.distage.model.definition.ModuleDef]] DSL
  *
  * @param roots    Garbage collection [[izumi.distage.model.plan.Roots roots]]. distage will ignore all bindings that aren't transitive dependencies
  *                 of the chosen Root [[izumi.distage.model.reflection.DIKey keys]] from the plan - they will never be instantiated.
  *
  *                 Effectively, the choice of roots selects a *sub-graph* of the largest possible object graph
  *                 that can be described by `bindings` - the sub-graph that only includes components designated as `roots`
  *                 and their transitive dependencies.
  *
  *                 On [[izumi.distage.model.plan.Roots.Everything]] garbage collection will not be performed â€“ that would be equivalent to
  *                 designating _all_ DIKeys as roots.
