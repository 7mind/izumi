What is it?
===========

Izumi (*jap. Ê≥âÊ∞¥, spring*) is a set of independent libraries and frameworks allowing you to significantly increase productivity of your Scala development.
 
including the following components:

1. [distage](https://izumi.7mind.io/latest/release/doc/distage/) ‚Äì Staged, transparent and debuggable runtime & compile-time Dependency Injection Framework,
2. [logstage](https://izumi.7mind.io/latest/release/doc/logstage/) ‚Äì Automatic structural logs from Scala string interpolations,
3. [idealingua](https://izumi.7mind.io/latest/release/doc/idealingua/) ‚Äì API Definition, Data Modeling and RPC Language, optimized for fast prototyping ‚Äì like gRPC, but with a human face. Currently generates servers and clients for Go, TypeScript, C# and Scala,
4. [Opinionated SBT plugins](https://izumi.7mind.io/latest/release/doc/sbt/) ‚Äì Reduces verbosity of SBT builds and introduces new features ‚Äì inter-project shared test scopes and BOM plugins (from Maven),
5. [Percept-Plan-Execute-Repeat (PPER)](https://izumi.7mind.io/latest/release/doc/pper/) ‚Äì a pattern that enables modeling very complex domains and orchestrate deadly complex processes a lot easier than you're used to.

Key goals 
=========

We aim to provide tools that:

1. Boost productivity and reduce code bloat
2. Are as non-invasive as possible
3. Are introspectable
4. Are better than anything else out there :3

Current state and future plans
==============================

We are looking for early adopters, contributors and sponsors.

This project is currently a work in progress.

In the future we are going to (or may) implement more tools based on PPER approach:

1. Best in the world build system
2. Best in the world cluster orchestration tool
3. Best in the world load testing/macro-benchmark tool
