What is it?
===========

Izumi (*jap. 泉水, spring*) is a set of non-coupled tools allowing you to significantly increase productivity of your Scala development.
 
including the following components:

1. [Percept-plan-execute-repeat (PPER)](https://izumi.7mind.io//pper) toolchain, allowing you to model 
   very complex domains and orchestrate deadly complex processes lot easier than you get used to,
1. Generative and introspectable runtime DI framework, [distage](https://izumi.7mind.io/distage), 
2. Effortless structured logging framework, [logstage](https://izumi.7mind.io/logstage),
3. Staged Interface Definition and Data Modeling language, [idealingua](https://izumi.7mind.io/idealingua) 
   supporting many target languages including Go, Typescript and C#,
4. A set of opinionated [SBT plugins](https://izumi.7mind.io/sbt) allowing you to significantly 
   increase clarity of your builds and compactify build files.

Key goals 
=========

We aim to provide tools which are:

1. Boosting productiviy 
2. Non-invasive as it possible
3. Introspectable
4. Better than anything else :3

Current state and future plans
==============================

We are looking for early adopters, contributors and sponsors.

The work is still in progress.

In the future we are going to (or just may) implement the following tools based on PPER approach:

1. Best in the world build system
2. Best in the world cluster orchestration tool
3. Best in the world load testing/macrobenchmark tool
